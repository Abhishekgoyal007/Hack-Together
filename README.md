# HackTogether Documentation

## Product Idea

**HackTogether** is a platform where developers can connect with other developers, showcase their achievements, and explore new opportunities through bounty listings. The platform aims to create a collaborative environment where users can display their wins, share the bounties they have successfully hacked, and discover new projects to work on.

## Problem Statement

HackTogether addresses several challenges faced by both hackers and bounty sponsors:

- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring that high-quality hackers are matched with projects, leading to better builds that meet the expectations of protocols and clients.
  
- **Fraud Prevention**: The platform focuses on preventing fraudulent profiles.  
  - **Case 1**: Mitigating the issue of teammates skipping tasks at the last moment.
  - **Case 2**: Protecting hackers' profiles from being compromised, a common issue on some major Web 2.0 platforms.
  
- **Efficient Discovery**: Hackers often have to navigate through multiple platforms to find suitable projects or collaborators, which can be time-consuming and disorganized. HackTogether aims to centralize this process.

- **Client Needs**: Clients can list tasks based on their specific requirements, which can range from bounty tasks to freelance opportunities.

## Product Summary

HackTogether is a platform where developers can meet new developers, showcase their wins, and explore new opportunities through bounty listings. The platform also proposes to provide a space for clients to list bounties and other freelance tasks, creating a seamless experience for both hackers and sponsors.
